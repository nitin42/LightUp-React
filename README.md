## Why to use lightup?

- **Quick demo** - So you want to introduce React to your friends or those who are not using it. You can use this tool to rapidly launch the app and explain them how the components are built and rendered or how does the event system works in React.

- **Trying out** - You are trying out something captivating that is not relevant to your project but it is to React. 
- **Discussions** - You want to reason about your app or want to explain the different components that your app will contain   to your colleagues. You can make this process more agile by using **`lightup`**. Typical approach is using a pre-installed boilerplate.

## Install

```
yarn add lightup-react 
```
or use npm ðŸ˜„

## Minutiae

**`lightup`** is a simple cli tool to quickly launch your React app. It makes your process of setting up the app effortless. Just focus on building the components and styling. And when you are done with basic app setup use **`lightup`** to start the app. 

**`lightup`** takes the advantage of **`react-scripts`** and **`react-dev-utils`** for enhancing the cli and [survivejs](survivejs.com) for implementing composing configuration using the new  [Webpack 2](webpack.js.org)

## Status

Currently the tool is equipped with a basic  development server. Although the main objective of the tool is to start the app and not focusing on generating or preparing for the production build (for such use cases which involves building a large app with React, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is the best fit) but I think I'm gonna make some minimal updates for generating the bundle (totally optional but I think it fills the gap).
